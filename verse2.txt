you ever love some body so much
you can barely breathe when you're with them you meet
and neither one of you
even know what hit'em got that warm fuzzy feeling yills
used to get them now you getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
you swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
you push, pull each other's hair, scratch claw, bit 'em throw 'em down, pin 'em
so lost in the moments when you're in them it's the range that took over, it
controls you both
so they say your best go your separate ways
guess that they dont't know you cause today
that was yesterday
yesterday is over it's a different day
sound like broken records playing over but you promise her
next time you show restraint
you don't get anothor chance,
life is a no nintendo game, but you lie again
now you get to watch her leave
out the window guess that's why they call it window pane
